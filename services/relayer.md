# Relayer

The [Relayer](https://github.com/snapshot-labs/sx-ui) will submit transactions received by the UI to StarkNet. We will have a mechanism that will allow DAOs to fund the transactions the relayer submits so that there is a zero cost user experience. However importantly, users can directly interact with Snapshot X and therefore do not rely on trusting the relayer to not censor votes. In the future we also plan to decentralise the relayer, allowing anyone to run one, further reducing the trust assumptions of using it.
